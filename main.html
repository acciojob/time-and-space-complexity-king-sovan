	 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of the input. It is crucial in analyzing the efficiency of algorithms. Algorithms with lower time complexity are more efficient, as they can solve problems with larger inputs in a reasonable amount of time. Developers often strive to design algorithms with optimal time complexity to ensure efficient execution.

        Space Complexity is another important aspect to consider in algorithm analysis. It refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. When we say an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means the space required by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. This is a common scenario, especially in algorithms that use arrays or lists. <b>Space Complexity</b> helps us understand how much memory an algorithm needs to complete its task and is vital in optimizing memory usage.
